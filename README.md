🎓 Syllabus AI: The Anti-Hallucination Tutor
Syllabus AI is a next-generation educational platform designed to solve the biggest problem with ChatGPT: Hallucinations and Out-of-Syllabus answers.

Unlike general AI, Syllabus AI creates a mathematically "Strict Boundary" around your uploaded PDF notes. It refuses to answer questions outside the syllabus unless explicitly authorized, ensuring students study exactly what is required for their exams.

 Key Features:-
🛡️ Strict RAG Engine: Answers questions only from the uploaded PDF. Returns a Green Tag (✅ Syllabus Verified) for trusted answers and an Orange Tag (🌐 Internet Verified) only when allowed to search externally.
📝 Mock Exam Generator: Auto-generates structured exam papers (MCQs, Short & Long Theory) based on your specific notes.
🧠 PYQ Trend Analyzer: Upload previous year question papers to identify High Probability Trends and get solutions derived strictly from your notes.
🎥 YouTube Syllabus Matcher: Paste a video link, and the AI extracts/summarizes only the parts relevant to your syllabus.
🔒 100% Offline & Private: Powered by Local LLMs (Phi-3 via Ollama) and FAISS Vector DB. Zero data leaves the device.
🎙️ Voice-First Interface: Full hands-free Voice Input and Text-to-Speech support for accessible learning.
